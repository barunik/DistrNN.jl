# DistrNN.jl

Available upon request. The code will be available to public when the publication process is finished.

The code has been developed in Julia accompanying the Barunik and Hanus (2022) paper, and provides estimation of probability distributions using *distributional deep learning* introduced in

Barun√≠k, J. and Hanus, L. (2022): *Taming data-driven probability distributions*, manuscript [available here for download](https://barunik.github.io)

**For now**, please refer to the code peraining to a special case for hourly electricity prices. See [Learning Probability Distributions of Day-Ahead Electricity Prices](https://github.com/luboshanus/DistrNNEnergy.jl).
